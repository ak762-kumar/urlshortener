/**
 * A custom exception thrown when a requested short URL is not found in the
 * database.
 *
 * We are extending RuntimeException, which means this is an "unchecked"
 * exception.
 * In the context of a Spring REST API, it's common to use unchecked exceptions
 * for
 * server errors (like a 404 Not Found) because they don't force the calling
 * code
 * to use a try-catch block, leading to cleaner controller logic. The exception
 * can
 * be caught and handled globally.
 *
 * @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND): This is a powerful Spring annotation.
 * It tells Spring that whenever this exception is thrown and bubbles up to the
 * web layer without being caught, it should automatically be translated into an
 * HTTP response with a 404 Not Found status code. This gives us a simple and
 * effective way to handle our error case without yet needing a
 * full @ControllerAdvice.
